# compsegcode
The code for the complex segment learner, Gouskova and Stanton (2019)

To see the available command line options, run:

$ python3 compseg.py --help

To run the learner offline, you would put all the .py files from this repo into a "code" folder, and create a "data" folder at the same level as "code". This will allow you to use the --language switch (see 'help' for more).

There is a more user-friendly interface for the learner on the project website, <a href="http://compseg.lingexp.org">compseg.lingexp.org</a>.
