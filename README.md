# compsegcode
The code for the complex segment learner, Gouskova and Stanton (2019)

To see the available command line options, run:

$ python3 compseg.py --help

To run the learner offline, create a directory called "data" at the same level as "code", and put your LearningData.txt and Features.txt files there. Give the directory a one-word name (e.g. "hebrew" or "spanish"). This will allow you to use the --language switch (see 'help' for more).

There is a more user-friendly interface for the learner on the project website, <a href="http://compseg.lingexp.org">compseg.lingexp.org</a>.
